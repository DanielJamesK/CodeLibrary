Welcome to the Code Library help file.

Before you begin, this application has some dependencies. You must ensure you have ruby installed on your computer. The application requires the gems tty-prompt, which provides a elegant menu interface, tty-table, which displays the input data into a table, tty-font, which stylizes text for headings, and pastel, which adds color and styling to text. These gems will be automatically installed once you execute the runprogram.sh script.

To open the application you must first run the script entitled runprogram.sh in the terminal. The script is located in the DanielKurz_T1A3 directory. If you aren't already in this directory you can change into it by typing cd DanielKurz_T1A3 into the terminal. To run the script, type the command ./runprogram.sh in the terminal and press enter. After you run the script, it will install the neccessary gems and open the application in the terminal.
